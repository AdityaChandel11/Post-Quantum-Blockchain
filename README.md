# 🔐 Quantum-Resistant Blockchain with PQC & QKD (Academic Project)

A custom-built blockchain system developed from scratch, enhanced with **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** concepts and **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) simulation** to demonstrate future-ready data integrity and security.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **secure, tamper-resistant blockchain architecture** that goes beyond classical cryptography.  
It integrates **post-quantum security principles** to address emerging threats posed by quantum computing.

The system demonstrates how blockchain data can remain **verifiable, immutable, and secure** even in a post-quantum era.
